# Recent Earthquakes Worldwide Past 24 Hours

## Installation
run `python install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Overview
This was a fun project to work on since this was one of my first interactive visualizations. 
A simple but very informative scatter plot was the result of the code that is available within this repository. The plot allows you to zoom in/out and displays the magnitudes and locations for all earthquakes. Each circle represents an earthquake, varying in size and color. The larger and the closer to red, the higher the magnitude. 

The plot shows all earthquakes in the past day (at the time when this blog was written). 
*My original Scattergeo plot consisted of all recent earthquakes from the past month, but the plot file was too large. I decided to stick with the past 24 hours instead.* If you would like to check out my interactive scattergeo plot, please visit my blog!
