# Recent Earthquakes Worldwide Past 24 Hours

## Quick Overview
This was a fun project to work on since this was one of my first interactive visualizations. 
A simple but very informative scatter plot (**Figure 1**) was the result of the code that is shown below. The plot allows you to zoom in/out and displays the magnitudes and locations for all earthquakes. Each circle represents an earthquake, varying in size and color. The larger and the closer to red, the higher the magnitude. 

The plot shows all earthquakes in the past day (at the time when this blog was written). 
*My original Scattergeo plot consisted of all recent earthquakes from the past month, but the plot file was too large. I decided to stick with the past 24 hours instead.* Please feel free to explore the scattergeo plot below!
